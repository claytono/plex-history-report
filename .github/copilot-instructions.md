# Copilot Instructions for Plex Stats

- When running git commands, always pipe to `cat` to avoid issues with the pager
- Group multiple commands into logical sets and offer to run them in a single invocation or separately.
- Ensure no trailing whitespace is added to lines and all edited files have a final newline.
- Consult TODO.md to track progress and update it when completing tasks.
- Ask if new feature requests should be tracked in the TODO file.
- When processing tasks from the TODO file, focus on a single task at a time unless told otherwise.
- If a task requires multiple steps, ask if I want to break it down into smaller tasks and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Prefer editing files directly using your tools, instead of using shell commands
